This is a standard islands type problem.
To find the perimeter, we can break this down to how many sides are exposed.
So for each ice cream component, we just see how many sides are adjacent to empty, or are on the border.
Then just add that to a total.
My recursive DFS solution timed out on test case 11, so I used iterative BFS instead.
